# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models, Planning, and Capstone

This module covers advanced topics in humanoid robotics AI, focusing on vision-language-action models, motion planning algorithms, and a comprehensive capstone project that integrates all concepts from the course.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Understand foundation models and their application to robotics (CLIP, GPT, multimodal architectures)
- Learn about Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models including RT-1, RT-2, and PaLM-E
- Master motion planning algorithms for path planning, trajectory optimization, and task planning
- Apply planning techniques specific to manipulation and whole-body control
- Integrate concepts from all previous modules into a complete capstone project
- Design, implement, test, and present a comprehensive humanoid robotics system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:

- **Module 1**: Digital Twin of Humanoid Robots (simulation fundamentals, Gazebo, Unity)
- **Module 2**: Isaac Navigation Systems (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2)
- **Module 3**: Core robotics concepts and sensor integration
- Basic understanding of machine learning and neural networks
- Familiarity with robot operating systems (ROS/ROS2)

## Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Vision-Language-Action Models

Explore how modern foundation models enable robots to understand and execute tasks specified in natural language. Learn about multimodal architectures that combine vision, language, and action for embodied AI systems.

**Topics**: Foundation models, multimodal integration, VLA architectures (RT-1, RT-2, PaLM-E), implementation strategies, current challenges

### Chapter 2: Motion Planning and Control

Master the algorithms and techniques for planning robot motion, from basic path planning to complex whole-body control for humanoid robots. Understand both classical and modern approaches to motion generation.

**Topics**: Path planning algorithms (RRT, A*), trajectory optimization, task planning (PDDL, HTN), reactive planning, manipulation planning, whole-body planning

### Chapter 3: Capstone Project

Apply everything you've learned to design and implement a complete humanoid robotics system. This capstone project integrates simulation, navigation, planning, and VLA models into a functioning demonstration.

**Topics**: Project requirements, integration strategies, implementation phases, testing and validation, presentation guidelines, example projects

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Vision-Language-Action Models](vla-models/index.md) to understand how modern AI models enable natural language control of robotic systems.
