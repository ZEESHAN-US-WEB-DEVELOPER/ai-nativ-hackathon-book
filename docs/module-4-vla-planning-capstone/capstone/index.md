# Chapter 3: Capstone Project

The capstone project integrates all concepts from the course into a comprehensive humanoid robotics system. You will design, implement, test, and present a complete application that combines simulation, navigation, VLA models, and motion planning.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, you will:

- Integrate digital twin simulation with real-world planning algorithms
- Implement a VLA-based control system for natural language task execution
- Apply motion planning techniques to solve complex manipulation tasks
- Design and execute a complete robotics application from requirements to deployment
- Test and validate system performance under realistic conditions
- Document and present your work professionally

## Project Overview

The capstone project requires you to build an end-to-end humanoid robotics system that demonstrates:

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: Accept and parse task instructions
2. **Task Planning**: Decompose high-level goals into action sequences
3. **Motion Planning**: Generate collision-free paths and trajectories
4. **Simulation Integration**: Test in Isaac Sim or Gazebo before real deployment
5. **Navigation**: Navigate in complex environments
6. **Manipulation**: Grasp and manipulate objects
7. **VLA Integration**: Use vision-language-action models for intelligent control
