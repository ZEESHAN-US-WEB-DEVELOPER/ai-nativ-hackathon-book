# Digital Twin of Humanoid Robots

This module focuses on building digital twins of humanoid robots using simulation and rendering engines to mirror real-world physics, sensors, and interaction. The digital twin concept allows for accurate simulation and prediction of real-world robot behavior in a virtual environment.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Understand physics-based simulation for robotics
- Simulate gravity, collisions, and dynamics in Gazebo
- Use Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction
- Simulate core robotic sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Apply sensor noise and realism concepts to your simulations

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the digital twin module, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments
- Access to a computer capable of running Gazebo and Unity simulations
- Basic knowledge of 3D coordinate systems and transformations
