# Digital Twin of Humanoid Robots Implementation Plan

## Prompt Text

1.Add Module 2 structure in Docusaurus with three chapters focused on Gazebo, Unity, and sensor simulation.
2.Ensure module navigation and content strictly follow the approved specification.

## Response Text

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the digital twin humanoid robot module, including:
- Updated plan.md with technical context and project structure
- Created research.md with technology decisions and alternatives
- Created data-model.md defining core entities and relationships
- Created quickstart.md for user onboarding
- Created API contract for digital twin functionality
- Updated agent context with new technology stack information

## Outcome

Successfully created the implementation plan with all required Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts. The plan defines the structure for a Docusaurus-based module with three chapters focused on Gazebo physics simulation, Unity rendering, and sensor simulation, following the approved specification.

## Evaluation

The implementation plan meets all requirements: it defines the module structure with three chapters as specified, aligns with the approved specification, includes all required artifacts (research, data model, quickstart, contracts), and maintains the educational focus of the original specification.
