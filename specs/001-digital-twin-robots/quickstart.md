# Quickstart: Digital Twin of Humanoid Robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the digital twin module, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments
- Access to a computer capable of running Gazebo and Unity simulations
- Basic knowledge of 3D coordinate systems and transformations

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup Your Environment

The digital twin module uses three main technologies:

- **Gazebo**: For physics simulation
- **Unity**: For high-fidelity rendering
- **Docusaurus**: For documentation and learning materials

### 2. Access the Module

The digital twin robot module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Physics & World Simulation with Gazebo** - Understanding physics engines, gravity, collisions, and robot-environment interaction
2. **High-Fidelity Digital Twins with Unity** - Visual realism and human-robot interaction scenarios
3. **Sensor Simulation for Physical AI** - LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and sensor noise concepts

### 3. Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo

Start with the physics simulation chapter to understand how humanoid robots behave in realistic physics environments:

- Learn about physics engines and their parameters
- Explore gravity and collision dynamics
- Understand robot-environment interactions
- Practice with sample robot models and scenarios

### 4. Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Rendering with Unity

After understanding physics, move to the rendering chapter to learn how to create visually realistic digital twins:

- Explore Unity's rendering capabilities for robotics
- Learn about visual realism techniques
- Practice human-robot interaction scenarios
- Understand how visual feedback enhances robot understanding

### 5. Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation

Finally, learn about sensor simulation to complete your understanding of digital twin systems:

- Understand LiDAR simulation and point cloud generation
- Learn about depth camera simulation
- Explore IMU simulation with realistic noise models
- Integrate sensor data with physics and rendering systems

## Key Learning Objectives
